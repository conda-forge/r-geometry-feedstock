  summary: Makes the 'Qhull' library <http://www.qhull.org> available in R, in a similar manner
    as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
    intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations,
    and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2D, 3D, 4D, and higher dimensions.
    It implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does
    not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of non-convex
    objects, but the package does include some R functions that allow for this.
